There's a possibility that this single package may drastically
grow beyond its initial purpose, or at the very least, that it'll be the
gateway for client servers to ask for lower-level operations over the
network (i.e. redo logging, undo segmentations, caching, shared pools for multiple database endpoints, autoscaling pool size for varying resource usage,
and the all-to-important logging.

In the event that this does become the case, this preamble marks my awareness
that I may have bargained for more than I initially set out to do.
Who knows? Maybe this will even become a side-gig? Hopefully the core team
won't discover how incompetent and unprepared I really am. :)

In any case, if you're reading this and you're mildly intrigued, feel free to
tag along! The more, the merrier!

Wed 22:18 4-6-2020 (haha, like I'll really continue this labeling trend)
Today's agenda is configurations, online studies of other architectures, and
figuring out how to make thing's as simple as possible for me and my users.

Meta goals:
1) Pen-and-paper out some basic designs and move them to images
2) Scavenge pieces from my async LDAP project
3) Review that interesting video on EdgeDB's spectrum chat with the master node
    election. I think it'll be important to consider those concepts for future
    load-balancing scenarios.
